						<h3>WHY ITâ€™S IMPORTANT TO CLEAN YOUR HOUSEPLANTS</h3>
					</div>
					<p className="info">
						Removing dust and dirt from your leaves is important for your plant to be able to absorb sunlight. Plants
						use light to convert carbon dioxide and water into energy (sugar). The plant stores the sugar in the stem,
						leaves, roots and fruits - from which it then uses it to grow. Itâ€™s also in this process that oxygen is made
						- which is great for us and our homes! If the leaves are covered with dust, your plant canâ€™t collect enough
						light needed for this process - called photosynthesis - and your plant will starve.
